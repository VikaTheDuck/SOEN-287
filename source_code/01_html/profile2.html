<p><strong>Kawhi Anthony Leonard</strong> (/kəˈwaɪ/, born June 29, 1991) is an American professional basketball
    player for the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Leonard played
    two seasons of college basketball for the San Diego State Aztecs, and was a consensus
    second-team All-American as a sophomore. He was selected by the Indiana Pacers with the
    15th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft, but was traded to the San Antonio Spurs the same
    day. After seven seasons with the Spurs, Leonard was traded to the Raptors in 2018.</p>

<h3>High school career</h3>
<hr/>
<p>Leonard attended Canyon Springs High School in Moreno Valley, California, before transferring to
    Martin Luther King High School his junior year. In Leonard's senior year, he and Tony Snell led
    the King High Wolves to a 30–3 record. Leonard averaged 22.6 points, 13.1 rebounds, 3.9 assists
    and 3.0 blocks per game that year and won California Mr. Basketball.</p>

<p>Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Leonard was listed as the No. 8 small forward and
    the No. 48 player in the nation in 2009.</p>

<blockquote>
    "I think he's going to be a star. And as time goes on, he’ll be the face of the Spurs, I think. At both ends of the
    court, he is really a special player. And what makes me be so confident about him is that he wants it so badly. He
    wants to be a good player, I mean a great player. He comes early, he stays late, and he's coachable. He's just like
    a sponge. When you consider he's only had [two years] of college and no training camp yet, you can see that he's
    going to be something else."
